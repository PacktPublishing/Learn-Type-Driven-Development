This is the code repository for [Learn Type Driven Development](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-type-driven-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788838016 ), published by Packt.

**Benefit from type systems to build reliable and safe applications using ReasonML 3**

## What is this book about?
Type-driven development is the approach to programming that has types as the foundation of code. Dependent types are utilized to express relationships and other assumptions directly in the code, and these assumptions are checked by the compiler. This book will cover Type Driven Development and how to leverage the power of the type system to write future code consistent with your past design decisions.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore the type-driven concepts, with simple and compelling examples. 
* Understand how to get quick wins in safety by just starting to use basic types 
* Create modules and module types, apply module types (signatures) to modules 
* Enforce sophisticated logic using product and sum types as building blocks. 
* Capture interesting and useful information using static types to make a program safer and faster. 
* Arrive at the best way to express your rules about your system by exploring design space using static typing. 
* Use static types and the dynamic runtime in harmony to write even safer, faster code.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
let sumOfSquares(x: int, y: int) = { /* (1) */
  let xSq = x * x;
  let ySq = y * y;
  xSq + ySq
};
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you’re a programmer working with dynamically typed languages and are looking for ways to mitigate production runtime errors, Learn Type-Driven Development is for you. You’ll also find this book helpful if you’re a programmer working with statically typed languages looking for increased safety and improved performance.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
